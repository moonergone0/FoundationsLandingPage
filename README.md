My Foundations Landing Page Project


Apr 22, 2022 - last commit and finished this task! I began
this task on Apr 21, 2022. I have taken in a ton about how to
use HTML, CSS, and flexbox, specifically, to make pages look incredible what's more, be responsive. I am happy with the results of this made-up company landing page! I anticipate moving into JavaScript next furthermore, adding that usefulness to new undertakings when the opportunity arrives.
